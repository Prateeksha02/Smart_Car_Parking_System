    Smart Car Parking System   
</h1>
"Smart Car Parking System" aims at providing a smart solution to the parking problem by digitalizing the process to minimize human time and effort. Furthermore, to reduce the wastage of time and fuel in searching for an available parking space due to insufficient car parking spaces or inefficient car parking management.
<h2>
    Problem Statement
</h2>
With the rapid growth in the population, people prefer luxury and comfort over expense. Hence, there is an increasing demand for 4-wheeler in every family which is leading to the inefficient allotment of parking slots. We are still following the conventional method of searching for parking slots, which is not a conducive solution to this issue. 
The aim of this project is to propose a smart solution to this issue by digitalizing the process of searching for a parking slot, thus resulting in the smooth functioning of the same.
